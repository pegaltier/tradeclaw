# TradeClaw AI Improvement Implementation Log

## 2026-07-02 06:46 MPST (+0800) — verification-only refresh of the existing docs-only checkpoint (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: refreshed the existing docs-only checkpoint for the new day, kept the read-only research CLI `scripts/research/recost-segment.ts` documented as an intentional local tool, and re-verified its fail-closed no-DB behavior. The root README discoverability hook remains in place. Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned live repo status before writing the refresh and kept the checkpoint grounded in real outputs.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — kept the increment to the smallest useful change: verification-only docs refresh, not new runtime work.
External source applied: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify — kept the AI tracking surfaces aligned across README/handoff/matrix/log/STATE/board.

- `git diff --no-index --check -- /dev/null C:/Ai/_zaky_ai_board/KANBAN.md` exited 1 as expected and printed only the LF→CRLF normalization warning, with no whitespace-error lines.

Recommended next move: keep `scripts/research/recost-segment.ts` as an intentional local research utility, and when live Postgres access is available run the real-data probe against Railway Postgres to answer the cost edge question.

Settlement note (2026-07-02, added when this drift was committed): the probe was already answered against production Postgres on 2026-06-26 — the identical script was merged to main in PR #136 (`df8adeb4`) and run over 3,796 resolved trades: gross +0.0149R, net −0.4317R/trade, no asset-class × band cell net-positive at n ≥ 100 (see `docs/plans/2026-06-26-real-cost-track-record.md`). The "pending prod DB" status these checkpoints carried was doc-drift against the already-merged result; only the `--json` per-cell artifact remains uncommitted.

## 2026-06-30 06:41 MPST (+0800) — recost-segment keep-and-document refresh (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: refreshed the existing docs-only checkpoint for the current dirty tree, kept the read-only research CLI `scripts/research/recost-segment.ts` as an intentional local tool, and surfaced it in the root README scripts list so future agents can find it quickly. The CLI still typechecked cleanly and failed closed without DB env before the repo-local AI tracking docs were refreshed. Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned git status, inspected the live source/docs before editing, and verified with real commands.
External source applied: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify — mapped the relationship between the equity route, calibration migration, and the new read-only research CLI before deciding the script is safe and isolated.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose the smallest useful increment: verification plus docs refresh, no broad code churn.

## 2026-06-25 05:31 MPST (+0800) — monetization strategy-audit package verification and docs refresh (docs/tracking only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw` on the Mini `gpt-5.4-mini` tier, daily schedule `27 5 * * *`.

Decision: documented the new historical-only strategy-audit monetization path and verified the standalone `packages/strategy-audit-agent` workspace package. The audit package turns existing Backtest Lab output into a paid deliverable without touching live trade execution, billing, or broker access. Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: continuous-improvement — inspected live files, verified the package with real commands, and kept the increment scoped to one coherent change.
External source applied: ponytail — chose the smallest safe increment: docs/tracking plus package verification, no checkout/broker wiring.
External source applied: graphify — treated the root audit doc, the AI-improvement note, the package workspace, and the state/board surfaces as one connected monetization node.
External source applied: zaky-improvement-stack — kept the monetization experiment historical-only and approval-gated on payment/broker wiring.

```

Current checkout note: the pre-existing `package-lock.json` workspace-link change for `@naimkatiman/tradeclaw-strategy-audit` is still present in the worktree; this run did not modify it further.

Recommended next move: decide whether to promote the strategy-audit package to a tracked product experiment or keep it as a local prototype until owner/Fatin approve any payment/broker wiring.

## 2026-06-24 05:31 MPST (+0800) — graphify-out ignore hygiene (docs/tracking only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw` on the Mini `gpt-5.4-mini` tier, daily schedule `27 5 * * *`.

Decision: kept the low-risk `.gitignore` hygiene change that ignores generated `graphify-out/` output so future status scans do not pick up the graphify cache folder. The live working tree before the docs refresh showed only the pre-existing `.gitignore` modification. Code changes: `.gitignore` only.

External source applied: continuous-improvement — re-scanned live status and verified the change before reporting.
External source applied: ponytail — chose the smallest safe fix by ignoring generated output instead of touching the generated tree itself.
External source applied: graphify — treated `graphify-out/` as generated knowledge-graph output that should stay out of the repo status surface.

```

Final static/read-back verification after tracking-doc updates:

- Re-read `docs/ai-improvement/implementation-log.md`, `STATE.yaml`, and `KANBAN.md` after the final writes; the inserted 2026-06-24 tradeclaw row was still present and the following 2026-06-22 MobileIB0TelegramApp row remained intact.
- `git status --short --branch --untracked-files=all` -> `## fix/track-record-compliance-copy...origin/fix/track-record-compliance-copy`; modified files now shown were `.gitignore`, `STATE.yaml`, and `docs/ai-improvement/implementation-log.md`.
- `git diff --shortstat` -> `3 files changed, 66 insertions(+), 17 deletions(-)`.
- `git diff --check` -> exit `0`; only the expected LF->CRLF warning for `docs/ai-improvement/implementation-log.md`, no whitespace-error lines.
- `git diff --no-index --check -- /dev/null C:/Ai/_zaky_ai_board/KANBAN.md` -> exit `1` expected; only the expected LF->CRLF warning for `C:/Ai/_zaky_ai_board/KANBAN.md`, no whitespace-error lines.

## 2026-06-22 05:30 MPST (+0800) — post-metrics verification checkpoint refresh (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw` on the Mini `gpt-5.4-mini` tier, daily schedule `27 5 * * *`.

Decision: stopped before new runtime/source/test work because the branch and dirty lanes still need owner/Fatin review, but refreshed current verification evidence so reviewers do not rely on the 05:29 checkpoint. Fresh `git fetch --prune` kept `fix/track-record-compliance-copy` at `528cd3c8` aligned with `origin/fix/track-record-compliance-copy` (`0 / 0` ahead/behind), local `main` at `da2afa06 [origin/main: ahead 1]`, merge-base `004190974821f789b8b56979680de03fd77ebcad`, `origin/main` changed-path count `0`, HEAD changed-path count `11`, dirty-path count `13`, and dirty/remote overlap `0`. Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: continuous-improvement — re-scanned git status/history, fetched remote state, read the shared template and AI artifacts, planned one docs-only checkpoint, and verified with real commands before reporting.
External source applied: source-review-metrics-packet / trading-anti-mc post-metrics example — refreshed the existing metrics, handoff, matrix, README, STATE, and board artifacts rather than layering new runtime work on top of unresolved branch/dirty lanes.
External source applied: shadcn/improve — converted the branch and dirty-lane evidence into a concrete review sequence with real commands and expected warnings.
External source applied: ponytail — chose restraint and verification refresh over adding code to an unresolved review stack.
External source applied: graphify — treated branch, upstream, local main, dirty lanes, build/typecheck, app build warnings, STATE.yaml, and the central board as related review nodes before updating tracking.
External source applied: codebase-inspection/pygount — re-measured source/test/config size with dependency, docs, build, data, and public-static folders excluded.

## 2026-06-21 05:29 MPST (+0800) — post-metrics verification checkpoint refresh (docs-only)

## 2026-06-20 08:36 MPST (+0800) — post-metrics verification checkpoint refresh (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: stopped before new runtime/source/test work because the branch and dirty lanes still need owner/Fatin review, but refreshed current verification evidence so reviewers do not rely on the 05:26 checkpoint. Fresh `git fetch --prune` kept `fix/track-record-compliance-copy` at `528cd3c8` aligned with `origin/fix/track-record-compliance-copy` (`0 / 0` ahead/behind), local `main` at `da2afa06 [origin/main: ahead 1]`, merge-base `004190974821f789b8b56979680de03fd77ebcad`, `origin/main` changed-path count `0`, HEAD changed-path count `11`, dirty-path count `13`, and dirty/remote overlap `0`. Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned git status/history, fetched remote state, read the shared template and AI artifacts, planned one docs-only checkpoint, and verified with real commands before reporting.

## 2026-06-20 02:14 MPST (+0800) — remote-aligned feature-branch source-review checkpoint refresh (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: stopped before new runtime/source/test work because the branch and dirty lanes still need owner/Fatin review, and the active AI-improvement artifacts were stale. The previous metrics packet described `fix/track-record-compliance-copy` at `b52aae7d` with no upstream. Fresh `git fetch --prune` now shows the branch at `528cd3c8`, aligned with `origin/fix/track-record-compliance-copy` (`0 / 0` ahead/behind), while local `main` remains `da2afa06 [origin/main: ahead 1]`. Refreshed the existing source-review metrics packet, handoff, matrix, AI README, STATE.yaml, and central board so review starts from current evidence. Code changes: none this run.

## 2026-06-19 23:00 MPST (+0800) — source-review metrics packet for remote-clean branch/dirty-tree review (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: stopped before new runtime/source/test work because the current branch and dirty tree still need owner/Fatin review, but the existing plain handoff did not provide enough review-leverage metrics. Added `docs/ai-improvement/source-review-metrics.md` as a docs-only packet that groups dirty-lane churn, records post-packet dirty-path counts, captures source/test/config `pygount` size, and keeps branch/local-main posture review as the active next move. Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned git status/history, fetched remote state, read shared template and AI artifacts, planned one docs-only increment, and verified with real commands before reporting.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/source-review-metrics-packet.md` — used the dirty-tree metrics packet pattern because a plain handoff already existed and the next useful action was review leverage, not new runtime work.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — converted current branch/dirty-lane evidence into an execution-ready, file-specific review sequence.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose documentation/metrics over adding code on top of unresolved branch and dirty lanes.
External source applied: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify — mapped current branch, local main, merge-base, dirty lanes, AI tracking docs, `STATE.yaml`, and the central board as related review surfaces before updating artifacts.
External source applied: codebase-inspection/pygount — measured source/test/config size with dependency, docs, build, data, and public-static folders excluded.

## 2026-06-19 19:46 MPST (+0800) — remote-clean branch/dirty-tree handoff refresh (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: stopped before adding new runtime/source/test work because the live checkout changed materially from the prior handoff. Current branch is `fix/track-record-compliance-copy` at `b52aae7d`, has no upstream, and includes the track-record compliance-copy change in `HEAD`; local `main` remains `da2afa06 [origin/main: ahead 1]`. `git fetch --prune` plus merge-base comparison found `origin/main` changed-path set zero and dirty/origin overlap zero. Refreshed the existing handoff, verification matrix, AI README, project state, and central board so reviewers see 12 tracked dirty files (8 non-AI review-lane files + 4 AI tracking/status docs) and no untracked files. Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned git status/history, remote merge-base state, current AI artifacts, project state, central board, and relevant manifests before acting; selected one stabilization/documentation increment and verified with real commands.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/uncommitted-source-verification-handoff.md` — followed the remote-clean/local-lane and stale-handoff refresh pattern when a prior handoff misclassified the current branch/source state.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — converted the branch/status mismatch into an execution-ready, file-specific stabilization plan instead of broad advice.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose documentation/restraint over layering another code change onto unreviewed branch and dirty lanes.
External source applied: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify — mapped relationships between current branch `b52aae7d`, local `main` `da2afa06`, remote-clean merge-base state, 8 dirty non-AI lanes, AI tracking/status docs, STATE.yaml, and the central board before recommending review order.
External source applied: https://github.com/Nutlope/hallmark — kept the track-record copy as a public trust/legal review surface and documented that it is committed branch copy rather than silently treating it as accepted runtime behavior.

## 2026-06-19 16:35 MPST (+0800) — track-record dirty-lane handoff refresh (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: stopped before adding new runtime/source/test work because the repo remains local-ahead and dirty, and the active handoff/matrix undercounted the current dirty tree after `apps/web/app/track-record/TrackRecordClient.tsx` appeared as an additional modified source file. Refreshed the existing handoff, verification matrix, AI README, project state, and central board to separate three lanes: local commit `da2afa06`, the now-9 prior dirty review-lane files (including the track-record trust-copy source lane), and 4 AI tracking/status docs. Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned git status, current AI artifacts, project state, central board, and the new dirty source file before acting; selected one stabilization/documentation increment and verified with real commands.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/uncommitted-source-verification-handoff.md` — followed the trigger for local-ahead plus dirty-tree handoff refreshes when active tracking docs and a new pre-existing source lane make prior counts stale.

External source applied: https://github.com/Nutlope/hallmark — treated the track-record return wording as a public trust/copy-quality surface and classified it for owner/Fatin review rather than silently accepting stronger or weaker marketing claims.

## 2026-06-19 13:24 MPST (+0800) — AI tracking/status dirty-tree handoff refresh (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: stopped before adding new runtime/source/test work because the repo remains local-ahead and dirty, and the active handoff/matrix undercounted the current dirty tree after recurring-agent tracking docs themselves became modified. Refreshed the existing handoff, verification matrix, AI README, project state, and central board to separate three lanes: local commit `da2afa06`, the 8 prior dirty review-lane files, and 4 AI tracking/status docs (`docs/ai-improvement/README.md`, this implementation log, `uncommitted-source-verification-handoff.md`, and `verification-command-matrix.md`). Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned git status, current AI artifacts, project state, central board, and relevant dirty-lane files before acting; selected one stabilization/documentation increment and verified with real commands.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/uncommitted-source-verification-handoff.md` — followed the trigger for local-ahead plus dirty-tree handoff refreshes where active AI tracking docs are themselves dirty and need a distinct lane.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — converted the current status mismatch into an execution-ready, file-specific stabilization plan instead of broad advice.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose documentation/restraint over layering another test, build-warning fix, or runtime change onto unreviewed lanes.
External source applied: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify — mapped relationships between local commit history, the 8 prior dirty lanes, AI tracking/status docs, STATE.yaml, and central board before recommending review order.

Do not start new runtime/build-warning work until that stabilization decision is made; the middleware/proxy migration remains owner/Fatin-approved.

## 2026-06-19 10:15 MPST (+0800) — local-ahead/dirty-tree handoff refresh (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: stopped before adding new runtime/source/test work because the repo is now both local-ahead and dirty: `main...origin/main [ahead 1]` with local commit `da2afa06` carrying the AI improvement docs, middleware matcher characterization test, self-host smoke checklist, and signal-lineage doc, while 8 tracked files remain modified in the working tree. Refreshed the existing handoff/matrix/AI README instead of creating a duplicate handoff so future runs no longer treat the AI docs/test artifacts as untracked. Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned git status, existing AI artifacts, project state, and central board before acting; selected one safe stabilization/documentation increment and verified with real commands.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/uncommitted-source-verification-handoff.md` — followed the refresh trigger for a prior handoff whose AI docs/tests were later included in a local committed-but-unpushed `HEAD` commit, while a dirty working tree remains.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — converted the current local-ahead/dirty-tree state into a file-specific stabilization plan instead of broad advice.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose documentation/restraint over layering another test or build-warning fix on top of unreviewed lanes.
External source applied: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify — mapped the relationship between local commit history, working-tree docs/tooling/test/static lanes, and project/central tracking before recommending review order.

## 2026-06-19 06:58 MPST (+0800) — uncommitted source verification handoff (docs-only)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: stopped before adding new runtime/source work because the live working tree already contained an accumulated diff from prior runs: 8 tracked modified files plus untracked test/docs artifacts before this handoff. Created a docs-only handoff and verification matrix so Fatin/owner/maintainer can split current changes into keep/revert/commit lanes before the next improvement. Code changes: none this run.

External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/uncommitted-source-verification-handoff.md` — followed the dirty-tree handoff pattern: inventory accumulated lanes, record current verification evidence, update repo-local tracking plus central board, and recommend source-diff stabilization before new runtime work.

```

Recommended next move: source-diff stabilization. Fatin/owner/maintainer should split the accumulated working tree into keep/revert/commit lanes using `docs/ai-improvement/uncommitted-source-verification-handoff.md`, rerun `docs/ai-improvement/verification-command-matrix.md`, and only then continue one unrelated safe increment such as build-warning triage. The actual `apps/web/middleware.ts` → `apps/web/proxy.ts` migration remains owner/Fatin-approved.

## 2026-06-19 — middleware matcher characterization test (test-only, new file)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: executed the repo-local recommended next move exactly — add a **test-only** matcher characterization for the current global middleware surface using Next's experimental testing helpers. Created exactly ONE new file; modified no existing file. No rename of `middleware.ts`; no change to auth, rate-limit, security-header, or matcher runtime code.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned live repo state, confirmed the installed Next testing export and the actual `export const config` matcher before writing, made one focused test-only increment, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — smallest valuable action: a single characterization test that pins current matcher coverage so a future owner/Fatin-approved `middleware.ts` -> `proxy.ts` migration cannot silently strip auth/rate/header coverage; no runtime, dependency, or config churn.

File created (exactly one; no existing file modified):

- `apps/web/__tests__/middleware.test.ts` — imports only `config` from `../middleware` (does not invoke the middleware function, so no auth/rate-limit logic runs) and asserts current matcher coverage via `unstable_doesMiddlewareMatch` from `next/experimental/testing/server`. Included paths asserted to match: `/api/health`, `/api/admin`, `/api/admin/signals`, `/api/webhooks/deliver`, `/dashboard`, `/embed`, `/embed/signal-card`, `/`. Excluded static assets asserted to NOT match: `/_next/static/chunks/main.js`, `/_next/image`, `/favicon.ico`, `/sw.js`, `/manifest.json`. (Creating the file created the previously-absent `apps/web/__tests__/` directory.)

Export-name note: the migration preflight doc references `unstable_doesProxyMatch`, but the installed Next version (`next@16.2.6`) only exposes `unstable_doesMiddlewareMatch` (verified in `node_modules/next/dist/experimental/testing/server/middleware-testing-utils.{d.ts,js}`). The test and its header comment use the export that actually exists.

Application/runtime behavior changes: none. Code changes: test-only (one new file).

Verification run and results:

```text
git status --porcelain  # confirm only-new-file
→ pre-existing modified/untracked entries unchanged; the ONLY net-new entry is ?? apps/web/__tests__/ (containing the new middleware.test.ts). No existing file modified by this run other than the two AI docs below.

npx jest --runTestsByPath apps/web/__tests__/middleware.test.ts --runInBand
→ PASS apps/web/__tests__/middleware.test.ts
→ Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
→ Tests: 13 passed, 13 total
→ All asserted include/exclude URLs matched the real `export const config`; no list adjustment was needed.
→ Non-fatal trailing notice (expected): "Jest did not exit one second after the test run has completed." — caused by the module-level `setInterval` rate-limit cleanup timer in `middleware.ts`. Not a failure; middleware.ts was NOT edited to silence it.

npx eslint __tests__/middleware.test.ts  # from apps/web workspace
→ exit 0; no output (no lint errors).

git diff --check
→ exit 0; no whitespace/conflict errors.
```

What did NOT change: `apps/web/middleware.ts` (not renamed, not edited), auth/`AUTH_RULES`, rate-limit logic, security headers, the matcher `config`, Next config, CI behavior, dependencies, runtime behavior, trading logic, tier definitions, DB schema, env vars, Compose services, cron behavior, and deployment targets.

Files changed / artifacts updated this run:

- `apps/web/__tests__/middleware.test.ts` — new test-only characterization file.
- `docs/ai-improvement/implementation-log.md` — this run log entry.
- `docs/ai-improvement/README.md` — refreshed recommended next move now that the characterization test exists.

Next safe action: the matcher characterization that de-risked the rename now exists. The actual `apps/web/middleware.ts` -> `apps/web/proxy.ts` convention migration (and `middleware`->`proxy` export rename) remains **owner/Fatin-approved** and out of scope for autonomous runs. If continuing autonomously, pick a separate, unrelated Safe Immediate Improvement (e.g., triage one of the other documented build warnings: lockfile/workspace-root inference, Turbopack/NFT trace warnings, or Node `url.parse()` deprecations) one at a time.

## 2026-06-19 — middleware.ts -> proxy.ts rename request: STOPPED, approval-required (no code change)

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Requested action this run: rename `apps/web/middleware.ts` to `apps/web/proxy.ts`, rename the exported `middleware` function to `proxy`, and update the `// 4. Middleware` banner comment plus the `[middleware]` warning-log tag to `[proxy]` — framed as a Safe Immediate Improvement to clear the Next 16 middleware-to-proxy deprecation warning.

Decision: **STOP — no code change made (`codeChangesNone=true`).** On closer inspection this is approval-required work under the repo's own established boundary, not a Safe Immediate Improvement.

Why this is approval-required, not safe-autonomous:

- `apps/web/middleware.ts` is the single global security/access-control surface. It owns API CORS preflight, in-memory per-IP rate limiting (`RATE_LIMIT_*`, public-feed allowances), admin/write-route auth via `AUTH_RULES` (fail-closed in production, fail-open with warning in dev), Bearer/cookie admin-session grants (`verifyAdminSession`, constant-time `safeEqual`), the global security-header set, and the `export const config` matcher that decides which requests get all of the above.
- The agent guardrail template (`C:/Ai/_zaky_ai_board/agent_prompt_template.md`) item 5 lists **major file renames** and **auth/authorization changes** as human-approval-required.
- The repo-local `docs/ai-improvement/middleware-proxy-migration-note.md` (preflight authored 2026-06-19 03:51) and `docs/ai-improvement/build-typecheck-parity.md` both already classify the `middleware.ts` -> `proxy.ts` convention migration as **owner/Fatin-approved**, and explicitly recommend adding matcher characterization tests *before* the rename so a subtle matcher/export mistake cannot silently strip global auth/rate/header coverage. No such characterization tests exist yet.
- Doing the rename now, before those tests, is exactly the silent-coverage-loss risk the existing preflight warns against. The task's own escape clause directs: "If on closer inspection it is actually approval-required or not verifiable, STOP, make no code change, and instead produce/append a short docs/backlog artifact ... set codeChangesNone=true."

External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — smallest-valuable-action / senior-dev restraint: declined a rename that the repo already documents as approval-gated; appended one short tracking note instead of mutating a global auth surface.
External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned live repo state and read the existing AI artifacts before acting; honored the prior preflight's owner/Fatin boundary rather than re-litigating it.

ls apps/web/middleware.ts  → present (10312 bytes)
ls apps/web/proxy.ts       → No such file or directory (rename intentionally NOT performed)
```

The verification plan in the task (rename check, `grep` for `export async function proxy`, web build) was NOT run because no rename was performed. Running the build would only reproduce the already-documented deprecation warning, which the prior preflight already captured.

Next safe action: unchanged from the prior preflight — add a test-only matcher characterization for the current `apps/web/middleware.ts` (Next `next/experimental/testing/server` helpers) covering include paths (`/api/health`, `/api/admin/*`, `/api/webhooks/deliver`, `/dashboard`, `/embed/*`) and static exclusions (`/_next/static`, `/_next/image`, `/favicon.ico`, `/sw.js`, `/manifest.json`), accounting for the module-level rate-limit cleanup timer. The actual `middleware.ts` -> `proxy.ts` rename + `middleware`->`proxy` export change stays owner/Fatin-approved.

## 2026-06-19 03:51 MPST (+0800) — Next 16 middleware/proxy migration preflight

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the repo-local recommended next move from the build/typecheck parity note: triage one observed Next build warning, specifically the Next 16 middleware-to-proxy convention deprecation. Source inspection showed `apps/web/middleware.ts` is not a cosmetic wrapper; it owns CORS preflight, API rate limiting, admin/write-route auth, security headers, and matcher coverage. Because the existing parity note marks middleware/proxy renames as owner/Fatin-reviewed work, this run stayed docs-only and created a migration preflight instead of renaming files.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned live repo state, read existing AI artifacts and source-of-truth manifests/docs before editing, made one focused docs-only increment, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack approval-gated design-note guidance — converted an approval-sensitive route/security convention change into a documented preflight with owner/Fatin boundaries instead of changing runtime behavior.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — used a file-specific warning triage and execution-ready future migration plan rather than broad build-system advice.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose the smallest useful action: documentation and test plan only, no source rename, no matcher/auth/rate/header changes, and no dependency/config churn.
External source applied: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify — mapped the relationships between middleware responsibilities, route coverage, Next config, CI checks, and future verification before any convention migration.

## 2026-06-18 23:04 MPST (+0800) — Root `typecheck:web` alias

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the repo-local recommended next move from the build/typecheck parity note: add one root script alias for the already-verified web TypeScript check and align contributor-facing docs to use it. This was tooling/DX only. It did not change Next config, CI behavior, dependencies, runtime behavior, trading logic, tier definitions, subscription rules, auth, billing, DB schema, env vars, cron behavior, Docker Compose services, or deployment targets.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned live repo state, read existing AI artifacts and source-of-truth manifests before editing, verified the raw command before adding the alias, made one focused increment, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/next-build-typecheck-parity.md` — followed the safe tooling follow-up pattern for a Next.js monorepo whose `next build` skips TypeScript validation while CI runs a separate `tsc --noEmit` check.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — used file-specific command-contract edits instead of broad build-system recommendations.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose the smallest useful DX change: one script alias plus docs/tracking alignment, with no config, CI, dependency, or runtime changes.

Next safe action: source-inspect and triage one observed Next build warning at a time, starting with the middleware-to-proxy deprecation only if the installed Next 16 docs and `apps/web/middleware.ts` show a behavior-preserving convention migration path. Keep warning cleanup separate from `ignoreBuildErrors`, CI blocking behavior, package-manager/lockfile policy, output tracing, runtime behavior, trading logic, tier rules, schema, env vars, Docker Compose, and deployment targets unless owner/Fatin explicitly approve.

## 2026-06-18 20:54 MPST (+0800) — Build/typecheck parity operator note

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the repo-local recommended next move: document the current build/typecheck split and align contributor-facing command guidance. This was docs-only. It did not change Next config, package scripts, CI behavior, dependencies, runtime behavior, trading logic, tier definitions, subscription rules, auth, billing, DB schema, env vars, cron behavior, Docker Compose services, or deployment targets.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned live repo state, read existing AI artifacts and source-of-truth manifests before editing, made one focused docs/DX increment, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/recurring-doc-alignment.md` — followed the docs-only alignment pattern: inspect package/config/CI/source-of-truth docs, update only the stale command contract, update repo-local/central tracking, and verify with read-back/static checks.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — used a file-specific operator note and public command-table edits instead of broad build-system recommendations.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose documentation and command-order clarification instead of changing Next config, CI, package scripts, lockfiles, or dependencies.

## 2026-06-18 17:39 MPST (+0800) — `/api/signals` TA worker fallback premium-band route-response tests

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the repo-local recommended next move: complete the TA worker fallback premium-band route-response seam for `/api/signals`. This was intentionally test-only. It did not change application/runtime behavior, trading logic, tier definitions, subscription rules, auth, billing, DB schema, env vars, cron behavior, broadcast routing, Docker Compose services, or deployment targets.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned live repo state, read existing AI artifacts and source before editing, made one focused test increment, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/route-disclosure-contract-test.md` — followed the route-disclosure pattern: inspect the route/helper/test harness, establish targeted baseline, cover the remaining fallback branch premium-band free-drop/Pro-retain route response, run targeted Jest and lint, and update tracking artifacts.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — used the existing route-test harness and file-specific recommended next move instead of broad audit prose.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose the smallest useful safety improvement: two tests in one existing file, no runtime code, no new dependencies, and no refactor.

Next safe action: create a docs-only build/typecheck parity operator note so contributors understand `npm run build` versus the CI-style TypeScript contract while leaving Next config, scripts, dependencies, runtime behavior, trading logic, tier rules, schema, env vars, and deployment targets unchanged.

## 2026-06-18 15:29 MPST (+0800) — `/api/signals` TA worker fallback Pro/full-detail route-response test

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the repo-local recommended next move: add the paired Pro/full-detail route-response contract on the TA worker fallback branch. This was intentionally test-only. It did not change application/runtime behavior, trading logic, tier definitions, subscription rules, auth, billing, DB schema, env vars, cron behavior, broadcast routing, Docker Compose services, or deployment targets.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned live repo state, read existing AI artifacts and source before editing, made one focused test increment, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/route-disclosure-contract-test.md` — followed the route-disclosure pattern: inspect the route/helper/test harness, establish targeted baseline, add one paid-disclosure route assertion, run targeted Jest and lint, and update tracking artifacts.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — used the existing source map and previous route-test harness to make a file-specific contract test rather than a broad recommendation.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose the smallest useful safety improvement: one fallback-branch test, no runtime code, no new dependencies, and no refactor.

## 2026-06-18 12:46 MPST (+0800) — `/api/signals` TA worker fallback locked-stub route-response test

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the repo-local recommended next move: mirror the `/api/signals` free-tier locked-stub route-response contract on the TA worker fallback branch. This was intentionally test-only.

Patch-tool note: an automatic broad TypeScript check after the first test-file edit surfaced existing workspace/module-resolution errors unrelated to this test-only change. The touched route test passed targeted Jest and targeted app-workspace ESLint.

Next safe action: add the paired TA worker fallback Pro/full-detail route-response test, proving the fallback branch preserves entry, stop loss, all TP levels, and raw indicators for `tier: "pro"`; keep it test-only and do not change signal generation, tier rules, schema, env vars, cron, or broadcast behavior.

## 2026-06-18 10:35 MPST (+0800) — `/api/signals` locked-stub route-response test

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the next safe autonomous increment from the repo-local recommended next move: extend the existing live-scanner `/api/signals` route-response tests so anonymous/free users get fresh standard-band signals only as public-safe `lockedSignals` stubs. This was intentionally test-only. It did not change application/runtime behavior, trading logic, tier definitions, subscription rules, auth, billing, DB schema, env vars, cron behavior, broadcast routing, Docker Compose services, or deployment targets.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — re-scanned live repo state, installed the declared npm toolchain before verification, read the relevant Next route-handler docs from `node_modules`, made one focused test increment, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — used the prior lineage map and existing route-test harness to make an execution-ready, file-specific contract test instead of a generic recommendation.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose the smallest useful safety improvement: one assertion-focused test case, no runtime code, no new dependencies, no broad refactor.

## 2026-06-18 08:50 MPST (+0800) — Signal data lineage maintainer map

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the next safe autonomous increment from the repo-local backlog: create a docs-only signal data lineage maintainer map before any future signal-generation, preset-semantics, tier-disclosure, broadcast, or outcome-resolution changes. This was intentionally limited to documentation/tracking and did not change application code, trading behavior, auth, billing, DB schema, env semantics, Compose services, cron behavior, or deployment targets.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — researched live repo state, planned one scoped docs-only increment, inspected source-of-truth files before writing, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/recurring-architecture-map.md` — followed the docs-only architecture/reference map pattern: inspect entrypoints/routes/auth/config/jobs/bindings, create a navigation artifact, update repo-local tracking, and verify via read-back/static checks.
External source applied: https://github.com/shadcn/improve — used execution-ready, file-specific planning to keep the map tied to concrete source files instead of generic architecture prose.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose documentation/clarity over runtime code because the safest useful increment was to map existing behavior, not add abstractions or dependencies.
External source applied: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify — mapped relationships across scanner files, API routes, tier gates, database rows, premium feeds, broadcast ledgers, and public proof surfaces before recommending tests.

App build/typecheck/full test suite were not run because this run changed only Markdown/tracking artifacts and `STATE.yaml`; the only targeted Jest attempt was blocked by missing local Jest installation. Static/read-back checks and source-token verification were the appropriate completed verification for this docs-only increment.

Next safe action: extend the existing helper-level free-vs-Pro disclosure coverage into a narrow `/api/signals` route-response contract test if the route test harness is clear; do not change signal generation, tier definitions, subscription rules, schema, env vars, cron behavior, or broadcast routing.

## 2026-06-18 07:08 MPST (+0800) — README banner SVG duplicate-attribute fix

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the next safe autonomous increment from the repo-local backlog: remove the parser warning in the public README/social-preview banner SVG. This was intentionally limited to one duplicated `x="80"` attribute in `apps/web/public/readme-banner.svg`; no asset redesign, application code, trading behavior, auth, billing, DB schema, env semantics, Compose services, or deployment targets were changed.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — researched live repo state and existing improvement docs first, made one focused change, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — smallest useful fix: delete only the redundant SVG attribute instead of redesigning the banner or touching unrelated code.

Files changed / artifacts updated:

- `apps/web/public/readme-banner.svg` — removed the duplicate `x="80"` attribute from the TradeClaw wordmark `<text>` element.
- `docs/ai-improvement/README.md` — marked the SVG warning mitigated, moved the backlog row to done, and promoted signal data lineage docs as the next safe action.
- `docs/ai-improvement/implementation-log.md` — this run log entry.
- `STATE.yaml` — updated timestamp and TC-042 notes as required by project-local operator rules.
- `C:/Ai/_zaky_ai_board/KANBAN.md` — central board latest-artifact row for this run.

Application/runtime behavior changes: none. Code changes: none; one public SVG asset markup fix only.

App tests/build were not run because no application code or runtime behavior changed. Targeted XML parse, targeted `pygount`, stale duplicate-attribute search, and repository static checks were the appropriate verification for this asset-markup fix.

Next safe action: create a docs-only signal data lineage maintainer map covering scanner output, TA fallback, tier-gated disclosure, signal history, broadcasts, and outcome resolution before any trading-behavior or preset-semantics work.

## 2026-06-18 05:20 MPST (+0800) — Quickstart/help self-host alignment

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the next safe autonomous increment from the repo-local backlog: align stale setup/help guidance in `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and `docker-entrypoint.sh --help` with the current Docker Compose + PostgreSQL self-host path. This reduced onboarding risk without changing Compose services, environment semantics, migrations, auth, billing, trading logic, broker execution, or deployment targets.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — researched live source-of-truth files first, made one focused setup/DX increment, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/recurring-doc-alignment.md` — followed the source-of-truth docs alignment pattern: inspect manifests/config/routes/help text, update only the stale setup surface plus tracking artifacts, and verify with read-back/static checks.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — chose the smallest useful fix: update docs/help text and a stale comment instead of changing runtime behavior or adding dependencies.
External source applied: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify — mapped the self-host relationship between Compose services, app/API health, websocket relay, migrations, Redis, and monitoring before rewriting the quickstart.

- `apps/web/lib/db.ts`

Files changed / artifacts updated:

- `docs/QUICKSTART.md` — rewrote the stale quickstart to match current Compose-required secrets, Postgres/no-SQLite posture, app/API port `3000`, websocket relay port `4000`, migration/smoke-check flow, current Telegram env names, and active `packages/signals` / TA-engine guidance.
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` — updated `--help` text and the migration comment only; the startup guard still runs migrations when `DATABASE_URL` is set and skips the runner when it is unset.
- `docs/ai-improvement/README.md` — marked the setup-doc drift item done and moved the next safe action to the known duplicate SVG attribute warning.
- `STATE.yaml` — updated timestamp and TC-006 notes as required by project-local operator rules.
- `C:/Ai/_zaky_ai_board/KANBAN.md` — central board latest-artifact row for this run.

Application/runtime behavior changes: none. Shell help/comment text changed in `docker-entrypoint.sh`; Markdown/tracking docs changed.

Verification run and results:

```text
git status --short --branch --untracked-files=all  # start of run
→ ## main...origin/main

→  M README.md
→  M STATE.yaml
→ ?? docs/ai-improvement/README.md
→ ?? docs/ai-improvement/implementation-log.md
→ ?? docs/self-host-smoke-checklist.md

read-back of docs/QUICKSTART.md
→ quickstart now documents Compose required secrets, `docker compose config --quiet`, app/API health on :3000, websocket health on :4000, the self-host smoke checklist, no bundled SQLite fallback, and current signal/indicator package guidance.

read-back of docker-entrypoint.sh
→ help text now lists PostgreSQL, USER_SESSION_SECRET, AUTH_SECRET, APP_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL, Telegram destinations, Compose validation, health checks, and the smoke-checklist link; migration guard line remains present.

stale-string search in docs/QUICKSTART.md and docker-entrypoint.sh for exact old claims (`SQLite by default`, `API Server | 3001`, `| Scanner |`, `npm run db:push`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, old data-provider sentence, retired scanner package path, and old execution-roadmap wording)
→ total_count=0

sh -n docker-entrypoint.sh
→ exit 0

sh docker-entrypoint.sh --help
→ printed updated help and exited before server start; output includes `docker compose config --quiet`, `docker compose up -d --build`, `/api/health`, and `:4000/health`.

docker compose config --quiet
→ blocked locally: `docker: command not found`
```

App tests/build were not run because no application runtime behavior changed. Static/read-back checks plus shell syntax/help verification were the appropriate scope; Docker runtime validation remains blocked on this host because the `docker` CLI is unavailable.

Next safe action: inspect `apps/web/public/readme-banner.svg` around the duplicate attribute warning reported by `pygount` and remove only the duplicated attribute if it is unambiguous.

## 2026-06-18 00:47 MPST (+0800) — First-run analysis baseline

Scope: recurring CEO Maulana repository improvement agent first run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: `docs/ai-improvement/` did not exist, so the first-run rule applied. This run created analysis artifacts only and did not modify application behavior.

External source applied:

- `naimkatiman/continuous-improvement` — used the research → plan → one thing → verify loop and first-run analysis-only guardrail.
- `safishamsi/graphify` idea from the shared template — mapped repository relationships before recommending changes.
- `DietrichGebert/ponytail` idea from the shared template — chose the smallest valuable increment: docs baseline only, no opportunistic code edits.

Skill note: `maulana-improvement-stack` was requested by the cron configuration but was unavailable in this Hermes profile, so the run used the central shared template's external-source list instead.

## 2026-06-18 02:13 MPST (+0800) — Contributor docs/DX alignment

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the next safe autonomous increment from the baseline backlog: align contributor setup and extension-point guidance with the live monorepo. This was documentation-only and did not change application behavior.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — researched live manifests/docs first, made one docs-only change, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/recurring-doc-alignment.md` — source-of-truth docs/DX alignment pattern: inspect manifests/env/templates/package boundaries, update only the stale doc + tracking artifacts, and verify via read-back/static checks.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — minimal-change choice: fix stale contributor guidance instead of touching code, dependencies, runtime behavior, or architecture.

App tests/build were not run because this run changed only documentation/tracking artifacts; static/read-back verification was the appropriate scope.

Next safe action: add a self-host smoke checklist for Docker Compose/Postgres/migrations/websocket/health verification, or inspect the known duplicate SVG attribute if Zaky prefers a tiny polish bugfix first.

## 2026-06-18 03:47 MPST (+0800) — Self-host smoke checklist

Scope: recurring CEO Zaky repository improvement agent run for `C:/Ai/tradeclaw`.

Decision: selected the next safe autonomous increment from the baseline backlog: document a post-deploy smoke checklist for the Docker Compose self-host path. This was documentation/tracking only and did not change application behavior, Docker services, environment semantics, database schema, auth, billing, trading logic, or deployment targets.

External source applied: https://github.com/naimkatiman/continuous-improvement — researched live repo/config/source first, made one docs-only increment, and verified before reporting.
External source applied: Zaky improvement stack `references/recurring-doc-alignment.md` — setup/deployment docs alignment pattern: inspect source-of-truth manifests/configs/routes, update only the stale docs/tracking artifacts, and use read-back/static checks.
External source applied: https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail — smallest valuable fix: document the existing Compose verification path and existing `scripts/test-docker.sh` helper instead of adding dependencies or changing runtime behavior.
External source applied: https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify — mapped the self-host service relationships across Compose, migrations, app health, websocket health, metrics, and monitoring before writing the checklist.

App tests/build were not run because this run changed only Markdown/tracking artifacts; static/read-back verification was the appropriate scope. `uvx --from pygount pygount` was rerun after documentation edits for codebase-inspection evidence; final totals are reported in the scheduled job output rather than pinned here because this implementation-log entry itself changes Markdown volume.

Next safe action: align legacy setup/help copy in `docs/QUICKSTART.md` and `docker-entrypoint.sh --help` with the now-current README + self-host smoke checklist, or inspect/fix the known duplicate SVG attribute warning if Zaky prefers a tiny static polish fix first.
